# GreaterThan

Greater Than is a distortion effect taken to its extremes. I wanted to challenge myself to make the most gross, noisy and out of control distortion with as little code as possible. We have a hard clip with infinite gain, reigned in by a noise gate with instant attack and release, and with a simple “analog style” octave up for good measure.

As minimalist as it’s looks and function are, as huge is it’s sound. The gate control can get you sputtery velcro fuzz sounds, or transform the quietest sounds to noisy soundscapes when turned all the way down. The octave up control can give you context dependent “octavia” style octave up sounds, or add a metallic ringmod texture to noisier material.

Great as a fuzz on guitars, try the octave up high with the neck pickup selected, or bass with the dry blend control. Or try it on drums with the gate high for pokey blips of noise, or turn the gate down and let it blow up your room mics through the roof. It can work great as a vocal distortion, especially if you don’t wat it to sound like a vocal.
